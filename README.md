Twitter Sentiment Analysis
This project implements a Twitter sentiment analysis model using Word2Vec embeddings for feature representation. The model is trained to classify tweets into different sentiment categories, leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

Features
Word2Vec Embeddings: Pre-trained Word2Vec embeddings are used to convert text into numerical representations.
Deep Learning Model: A neural network model is trained on the embeddings to predict sentiment.
Data Preprocessing: The pipeline includes text cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal, and vectorization.
Evaluation Metrics: The model is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
